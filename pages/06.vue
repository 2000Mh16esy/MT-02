 <h1>Kakku Pagodas</h1> 
 <p>
  One of the most amazing tourist places in Myanmar, the Kakku Pagodas complex houses 2,500 ancient small pagodas overlooking the hills near Inle Lake. While most of the pagodas are similar in shape and size, the central pagoda is 40 m high.

Most pagodas are made from bricks and coated with stucco and still have the hti. Many stupas are decorated with carved sculptures while some have enshrined images of the Buddha. Do plan a visit to this unique place and have a memorable experience.
