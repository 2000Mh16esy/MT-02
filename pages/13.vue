          One of the most ancient places to see in Myanmar, Shwezigon Pagoda served as the prototype of other Burmese stupas. Featuring a circular gold leaf-gilded stupa, it also has several beautiful smaller temples and shrines.

The main pagoda is a bell-shaped stupa sitting on a square base and has four large golden lions placed at each of its corners. Do plan a visit to this temple and be amazed by the beautiful and intricately carved facade and interiors.
