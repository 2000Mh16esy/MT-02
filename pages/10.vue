     <CardTitle>Towering 46 m, the Htilominlo Temple is amongst the most majestic places to see in Myanmar. It was constructed in the 1218 era under the rules of King Htilominlo and is similar in structure to the Sulamani Temple, which was built almost three decades ago.

The Htilominlo Temple is a marvelous brick structure with white intricately carved stuccos depicting ogresses and mythological animals such as Makara sea creatures. Its Shikhara is quite similar to that of the Ananda Temple except that it is not gilded.</CardTitle>
