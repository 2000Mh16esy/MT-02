 <h1>Mount Popa</h1> 
 <p>
  An ancient extinct volcano, Mount Popa is amongst the most religious tourist attractions in Myanmar. It is home to 37 temples dedicated to Mahagiri Nat spirits and a sacred pilgrimage place for the Burmese. Taung Kalat is the most famous shrine amongst the 37 temples and is dedicated to Goddess Popa.

To reach this shrine one has to climb about 777 steps but the architectural marvels and panoramic views of the surroundings are worth every effort.
