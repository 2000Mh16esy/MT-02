 <h1>Ananda Temple</h1> 
 <p>
  Amongst the most beautiful places to visit in Myanmar, the Ananda Temple amazes the visitors through its marvelous single-storey architecture and peaceful ambiance. The temple's most fascinating feature is its gilded Shikhara, a towering spire on top of the pagoda, which can be witnessed from miles away over the Bagan plains.

The illuminated Ananda Pagoda at night creates a mystical appeal and is indeed a sight to behold and capture. The pagoda was damaged during the 1975 earthquake but restored after extensive renovations
