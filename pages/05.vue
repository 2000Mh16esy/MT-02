      Inle Lake is certainly one of the most stunning places to visit in Myanmar for its blue water and majestic hills in the backdrop. It is the second-largest freshwater lake in Myanmar and spread over forty-five square miles.

The lake is a great place to witness the beautiful floating gardens, a wide range of flora and fauna, and spectacular sunset scenery. Take a private boat or shared boat to enjoy a thrilling sail through the waters and collect beautiful memories and pictures or buy a locally made product to take back as a souvenir
