 <h1>Dhammayangyi Temple</h1> 
 <p>
  Built during the reign of King Narathu, the Dhammayangyi Temple is the largest temple in the Bagan region. It appears like ancient pyramids from a distance and is one of the most attractive places to see in Myanmar.

It houses images of four sead Buddha each placed on the entrance gate and beautiful images of the Gautama Buddha and the Maitreya Buddha, placed side by side. The temple complex is enclosed in a wall with huge arched gates leading to the pagoda.
