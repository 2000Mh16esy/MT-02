  The Mandalay Royal Palace is the last architectural marvel built by Burmese Royals and is one of the most stunning tourist places in Myanmar. The complex comprises more than a dozen buildings, including audience halls, throne halls, a court building, a monastery, a watchtower, a library, a tooth relic building, etc. that are made up of teak wood and are surrounded by the walls of a citadel.

Today a section of the citadel complex is used by the Burmese army, whereas the Palace and surrounding gardens are open for the tourists.
