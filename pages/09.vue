     <CardText>
      A massive but incomplete pagoda settled on the bank of the Irrawaddy River, Mingun Temple was meant to be the largest pagoda in Myanmar. It houses two giant stone lions roughly 29 meters high guarding the pagoda.

The construction of the pagoda started at the end of the 19th century when King Bodawpaya wanted to build a 152 meters high structure. However, the project was not completed due to a lack of funds and labor. Nevertheless, it still serves as one of the famous worship places in Myanmar.
